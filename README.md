Difference Game : http://polytechnique-montr-al.gitlab.io/log2990/20231/equipe-306/LOG2990-306

An entire website made from scratch where the frontend and the backend has been worked on. The game consisted of finding the differences
between two images uploaded or drawn on the interface using a pencil. A player could either play at the game in Classis Mode (Solo) or in Multiplayer Mode. On Classic Mode, he has to find all the differences as fast as possible because a clock was ticking, and the objective is to beat his personal record or that of others. He could have asked 3 kind of different clues if needed but the use of clues 
would result in an increase of the time. One could also use the cheat Mode where all the differences would start blinking. In Multiplayer Mode, a player could play with someone else and the first one to find all the differences wins. They could communicate betweeen themselves using an active chat box.

In the project, the use of API's, databases as well as AWS were exploited on top of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Angular was also needed in making of this website.
